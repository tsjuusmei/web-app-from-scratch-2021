# Web App From Scratch @cmda-minor-web 2020 - 2021

In this course I will learn to build a web application without frameworks or unnecessary libraries, but with vanilla HTML, CSS & JavaScript as much as possible. The end result is a modular, single page web app (SPA). Data will be retrieved from an external API of my choice, manipulated and finally shown in the UI of the App. I will be learning different ways to structure code and develop my own coding style. With the gained knowledge, I will be able to build interactive prototypes, based on real data. Also I will gain a better understanding of how API's, frameworks and libraries work.

## Concept

I will create a dashboard in theme of *Mars* (the planet), where you can see the recent pictures of Mars sent by the Mars Rover. Also, the average temperature of Mars will be shown in the dashboard.
In my project I will be working with a NASA API, specifically the *[Mars Rover Photos](https://api.nasa.gov/#b-a10)* API and also a *[Mars weather API](https://api.mars.spacexcompanion.app/public/)*.

## Learning goals

* _I can add structure to my code by applying patterns. I can defend the choice for the chosen patterns_
* _I can retrieve data, manipulate it and dynamically convert it to html elements using templating_
* _I understand how I can work with an external API using asynchronous code_
* _I understand how I can manage state in my application and I inform the user of state where necessary_
